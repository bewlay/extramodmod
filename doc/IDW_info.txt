Changelog:
v1.1
	Update to MNAI 2.4.1
	Defeated Illusions and temporary units are excluded (permasummons are not)

Notes:
	"Active City Resistance" is not merged.
	Code taken from LoR 0.99b (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=319235): original was not for bts 3.19

Planned:
	IDW is affected by Civics (Sacrifice the Weak, Crusade and Slavery) or Alignment (Evil), Promotions (Command I-IV), Civ, Unit type (Heroes) etc... I think the following factors should affect quantity of transferred culture: 
		Loyalty of population (more culture transfer from evil civ's culture, particularly calabim, and from slavery civic)
		Fame of units (more culture transfer when a hero or high-level unit dies; curently high-level units just increase culture transfer on winning)
		Religious convincibility (civs with crusade civic, units with the command (X% chance to convert) promotion and disciple units in general should cause more culture transfer on winning)
	Maybe include "Active City Resistance". It's part of the concept at all.
	Maybe just enable IDW for fight with revolutions; the change of combat system is maybe too big.
