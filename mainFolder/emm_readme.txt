ExtraModMod is a modification of the popular Fall from Heaven II mod for Civilization IV. ExtraModMod strives to improve the gameplay of the original mod, add new interesting options and features and to stay true to the original lore of the Erebus setting.

The new features included in the mod are quite mature and stable, but some parts are still undergoing development. Testing, feedback and contributions are encouraged and highly appreciated.
