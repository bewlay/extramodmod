# ExtraModMod

**Forum Thread:** http://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/extramodmod.486227/

ExtraModMod is a modification of the popular [Fall from Heaven II mod](http://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/mod-fall-from-heaven-ii.171398/) for [Civilization IV](http://www.civiv.com/). ExtraModMod strives to improve and expand the gameplay of the original mod, to add new interesting options and features and to stay true to the [original lore of Fall from Heaven](http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=279). Most new features included in the mod are quite stable, but some parts are still undergoing development. Testing, feedback and contributions are encouraged and highly appreciated.


## Installation

You can find the latest release of ExtraModMod at the [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/Terkhen/extramodmod/downloads) section. If you don't know which version to use, installing the newest non-beta version is recommended. To install this mod you need to paste the compressed file's contents over a clean installation of Fall from Heaven II. That mod is available [here](http://forums.civfanatics.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1), and you also need to install patch 0.41o (available in the same link).

Please note that this mod is not compatible with Blue Marble.
