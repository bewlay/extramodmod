		<English>[H2]Mechanics[\H2]Each city in your empire has an [BOLD]instability[\BOLD] ([ICON_INSTABILITY]) value. Each turn, [ICON_INSTABILITY] is increased or decreased by factors such as happiness, distance to capital, religion, nationality, garrison, and others. These factors are listed below in more detail. All factors can be viewed in-game using the Revolution Advisor (%s1).[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:0]If [ICON_INSTABILITY] in a city rises over %d2, the city may instigate a revolt, possibly including nearby unstable cities. Revolts come in many different styles, including requests to change civics, requests to change state religion, and demands for independence. No matter what the scenario, you will always be given choices when confronted with a rebellious city. If you repeatedly deny demands and fail to improve stability, a violent revolution will break out.</English>

		<English>[H2]FfH integration[\H2]Revolutions are an experimental feature. While fully functional, this game option is only partially integrated into the mod. Instability mechanics have been adjusted to make sense in the world of Erebus, but actual revolts are still relatively generic. I (lfgr) plan to add more diverse revolution styles in the future, such as religion-specific uprisings.</English>

		<English>[H2]Instability factors[\H2]Below is the list of effects affecting stability every turn. This page is only inteded to give a rough overview, check the in-game Revolution Advisor (%s1) for more details. Most factors below are capped at some maximum stability or instability. In some cases, the cap can be changed by buildings or civics. There are also many buildings and civics that increase or decrease the effect of certain factors.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_REVOLUTIONS_CONCEPT_HAPPINESS</Tag>
		<English>[BOLD]Happiness/Unhappiness.[\BOLD] In most cases, the easiest way to keep your cities from revolting is through happiness. On the other hand, excess unhappiness majorly contributes to instability, unless special buildings or civics are used to counter the effect. [NEWLINE]Both effects are much more noticeable for smaller cities, since they're proportional to excess [ICON_HAPPY]/[ICON_UNHAPPY] divided by population size.</English>

	<TEXT>
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_REVOLUTIONS_CONCEPT_LOCATION</Tag>
		<English>[BOLD]Location.[\BOLD] Each city that is not your capital or a government center (i.e., has %s1) gets a location penalty depending on the distance to the nearest capital (or government center). Size is also a factor; large cities get a larger location penalty. Ways of reducing the location penalty is to connect your cities via roads, rivers, the sea, or teleportation (via %s2).</English>

	<TEXT>
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_REVOLUTIONS_CONCEPT_RELIGION</Tag>
		<English>[BOLD]Religion.[\BOLD] Cities with your state religion get a stability bonus. All other religions cause instability, depending on the level of animosity to your state religion. The worst penalty comes from %s1 vs. %s2. Even if your state religion is neither, they will still cause a small amount of instability.</English>
	</TEXT>
	<TEXT>
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_REVOLUTIONS_CONCEPT_NATIONALITY</Tag>
		<English>[BOLD]Nationality.[\BOLD] Foreign culture in your cities causes instability. The effect increases quadratically with increasing percentage, so small amounts of foreign culture should not be a problem. Culture from your team members does not count as foreign. Moreover, culture from vassals and other players with your civilization (with whom you're at peace) count partially.</English>

	<TEXT>
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_REVOLUTIONS_CONCEPT_GARRISON</Tag>
		<English>[BOLD]Garrison.[\BOLD] Stationing troops in a city improves stability. Your citizens take one unit per five population points for granted; you need more units to increase stability (though less units do not cause instability). Some promotions increase your units' stability bonus.</English>
	</TEXT>
	<TEXT>
		<Tag>TXT_KEY_REVOLUTIONS_CONCEPT_DISORDER</Tag>
		<English>[BOLD]Disorder.[\BOLD] Disorder causes a lot of instability, especially in cities that haven't revolted yet. Since instability again causes revolts, this can quickly snowball into an uprising. Some units can spread culture (%s1), which also ends revolts - it might be handy to have some of those at the ready.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_REVOLUTIONS_CONCEPT_MISC</Tag>
		<English>[BOLD]Other effects.[\BOLD][NEWLINE] [ICON_BULLET]Culture rate provides some stability. The effect grows with the square root of the actual culture rate, so you get diminishing returns when investing a lot in culture.[NEWLINE] [ICON_BULLET]Excess unhealthiness causes a small amount of instability.[NEWLINE] [ICON_BULLET]A golden age provides a big statbility bonus in all cities.[NEWLINE] [ICON_BULLET]If the number of cities is small, you get a small statbility bonus in all cities, whereas a large amount of cities causes a small penalty (the exact meaning of "small" and "large" depends on the map sizue.[NEWLINE] [ICON_BULLET]Various buildings and civics provide a flat stability bonus or instability penalty every turn.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_REVOLUTIONS_CONCEPT_STRATEGY</Tag>
		<English>[H2]Strategy[\H2]As mentioned, several buildings and civics modify the strength of the above effects. Some civics enable different play styles in this way. For example, [LINK=CIVIC_SACRIFICE_THE_WEAK]Sacrifice the weak[\LINK] procides a flat instability penalty each turn, and increases the likelihood of revolutions turning violent. On the other hand, the instability penalty from unhappiness is reduced, and the effectiveness of stationing military units in your cities in increased. This is useful e.g. for [LINK=CIVILIZATION_CALABIM]Calabim[\LINK] players, who rely on excess unhappiness in cities.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:0]Another example is [LINK=CIVIC_ARISTOCRACY]Aristocracy[\LINK], which has a hefty flat instability penalty (which has to be countered somehow), but decreases instability from distance, and therefore makes large empires more viable.</English>
