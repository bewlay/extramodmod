		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_BERSERKER_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>In later generations of the Age of Rebirth, most armies would deploy detachments of brutal men fueled by bloodlust called berserkers.

These elite units are inspired by legends from the Age of Ice, legends of men who carried an axe in each hand.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_CENTAUR_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Of the beasts formed by men only the centaurs retain some part of their noble nature. Many creatures were made from the bodies of men, but they were of ten reduced to the passions of their bestial form.  Perhaps it is because the animal they were made from, the majestic stallions of the Cerici, were known for their docile nature as well as their strength. But do not assume that the Centaurs are passive. Those creeping into their glades expecting gentle pacifists bounding away like deer when they see strangers will be surprised by the firm, battle-hardened giants they find.  Centaurs are fond of war paint and other body art, thick, dangerous weapons, and feasts of wild fruit and meat so undercooked it drips with blood.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_IRA_PEDIA</Tag>

Necromancers have to use magic to give them an aura of the undead to keep their skeletons from attacking them. Occasionally a skeleton will become obsessed with some fragment of his former life. A skeleton may carry a teddy bear, guard the ruins of a house, or wander behind a flock of sheep.</English>
