        <English>Duke Sallos appears in the official Scenarios as a minor leader and is also available as an extra leader in custom games.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Sallos was a soldier from a small and dismal duchy at the edge of the patrian empire. He grew tired of what he thought was a meaningless life. When he captured a Merry Dancer he sacrificed the creature in the hope that something will hear his call. His call was heard and Hyborem answered and offered him seven years of power in exchange for his eternal servitude and that of his descendants (his wife was pregnant with their son Asmodey at the time). Sallos accepted.[PARAGRAPH:1]In those seven years Sallos rose to become a patrian duke. After the time was over he died suddenly and after surviving the torments of hell, he became a ruler there as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is unusual for a mortal soul to rise to a duke in the demonic ranks. He maintains his status because his descendants remain devout to Sallos's pledge. They have formed a family secret society called the Daughters of Saleos based on demonic worship and incest (to keep their bloodline of Sallos pure).</English>

        <English>Meresin appears in the official Scenarios as a minor leader and is also available as an extra leader in custom games.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Also known as Father Whisper. Meresin was the headmaster of an orphanage and horribly mistreated the children in his care. He would offer the services of his orphanage to surrounding cities and then claim that the children had run away when most were locked beneath the orphanage until they no longer amused him, and then burnt alive in the ophanage's crematorium. He would use a barbed flail on the children, and occasionally himself.[PARAGRAPH:1]Though he was investigated, and a few children came close to escaping, Meresin was never caught and he tortured and killed hundreds of children in his life. It wasn't until a plague spread through the city, and Meresin began collecting the newly orphaned (and sick) children that he also contracted the plague that killed him. Then the town found the cellar where children were still caged and the floor was covered with ash and bones.[PARAGRAPH:1]The orphanage is still haunted by the spirits of the children that died there. Ghosts that linger in the crematorium and a Caller in the Darkness that dwells in the cellar. Children that pass too close to the ruins (especially at night) are drawn to them. An elohim priestess attempted to sanctify the ruins the the Age of Rebirth but was killed in the attempt and now her spirit wanders the area trying to find someone else to break the curse.[PARAGRAPH:1]After his death Meresin became a demon, his focus is on runaways. He is the voice that calls from the shadows, the comfort for the lost, and the voice that stokes the flames of anger and rebellion against parents. He still carries his barbed flail. If Meresin is summoned he can curse enemies with a disease that causes them to sweat blood or invoke feelings of lust, but he requires a living child in trade.</English>

        <Tag>TXT_KEY_LEADER_KOUN_PEDIA</Tag>
        <English>Minister Koun can enter the game as a minor leader after an Event in which a City requests freedom from your Civilization. There is a 50% chance for him to either start out on the Mother Civilization's Team, or independent (chance is determined at the start of the game). The Event to bring Minister Koun into the game will only appear in approximately 1/3 of all games played. All attributes of Minister Koun except his Traits will be based on the Mother Civilization (thus he shares the same Unique Buildings, Unique Units, Civilization Trait and World Spell). He will start in control of the Liberated City with 4 Archers and 1 Worker. Minister Koun appears in the official Scenarios as a minor leader and is also available as an extra leader in custom games.</English>

        <Tag>TXT_KEY_LEADER_OUZZA_PEDIA</Tag>
        <English>Ouzza appears in the official Scenarios as a minor leader and is also available as an extra leader in custom games.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]When Asmodey required the sacrifice of a child from every village, Ouzza's village (including his own father) offered him to curry favor with the powerful duke. First his mind was sacrificed by forcing him to imbibe a consecrated bottle of blood god wine, then his body was sacrificed, piece by piece. Finally, while he lay dying his soul was sacrificed to Agares.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares accepted the gift. And eventually Ouzza returned as a demon to claim a part of the villagers that so easily offered him up. From some a tongue, from others an eye, from some, a portion of their mind or soul.[PARAGRAPH:1]In battle, Ouzza can summon serpents from inside the body of living targets and his gaze causes paralysis. He carries a bloody machete with which he can remove limbs and a ritual knife for removing internal organs, which he usually does while his victims are still alive and paralyzed. Ouzza's magic will not work on those willing to sacrifice themselves to save others.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ouzza (who is also known as the Call of the Altar or Fleshcaller) answers prayers from those who have lost a body part and he can provide a replacement, though a corrupt version, and he expects a personal sacrifice of some type from the one calling him.</English>
