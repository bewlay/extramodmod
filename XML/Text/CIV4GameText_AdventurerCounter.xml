The amount of points generated is affected by anything that also affects the generation of Great People Points, such as civics like [LINK=CIVIC_PACIFISM]Pacifism[\LINK] or buildings like the [LINK=BUILDING_NATIONAL_EPIC]National Epic[\LINK]. Adventurers are created in the capital when the Adventurer counter (shown at the upper right part of the screen) reaches a certain value. Whenever the player gets a new adventurer, the value required to get the next adventurer will increase.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The value required to get a new Adventurer progresses in the same way that the value for getting new Great People is increased, and as a result is affected by game speed and other factors. The Grigori World Spell, [LINK=SPELL_ARDOR]Ardor[\LINK] will reset both the amount required to get new Great People and Adventurers.</English>
