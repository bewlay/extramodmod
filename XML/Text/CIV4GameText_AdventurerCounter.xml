        <English>[H1]Adventurer Counter[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2][LINK=UNIT_ADVENTURER]Adventurers[\LINK] are special heroes created by the [LINK=CIVILIZATION_GRIGORI]Grigori[\LINK] civilization. Adventurers are created in the capital when the Adventurer counter (shown at the upper left part of the screen) reaches a certain value. Whenever the player gets a new adventurer, the value required to get the next adventurer will increase.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]All cities can increase the counter, depending on their buildings. The [LINK=BUILDING_PALACE_GRIGORI]Grigori Palace[\LINK] gives the highest increase (20 points each turn), while the the [LINK=BUILDING_NATIONAL_EPIC]National Epic[\LINK] and the [LINK=BUILDING_HEROIC_EPIC]Heroic Epic[\LINK] increase the counter by 12 each turn. [LINK=BUILDING_ADVENTURERS_GUILD]Adventurers' Guild[\LINK] increase the counter by 6 points each turn, while [LINK=BUILDING_COMMAND_POST]Command Posts[\LINK] increase it by 3 each turn.
