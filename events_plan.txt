Gela:
[SPOILER]
Trigger: One of your units takes Gela
AI: Always Option 1

[I]The demon Hyborem has been vanquished, and his soul sent screaming back into the pits of Hell.  His weapon, the unholy Gela, is all that remains of this mighty demon.  Your forces, victorious, reach to claim the weapon that has been left behind.  But it is up to you to decide what will become of the demon’s legacy.[/I]

[B][U]Branch 1[/U][/B]
[B]1)[/B] [I]I shall keep the weapon.  Its strength shall become my own.[/I]
		Quest ends.  Basium cannot choose this.
[B]2)[/B] [I]The demonic taint shall be washed from this trident.  I shall cleanse it in the waters of the Pool of Tears.[/I]
		The player must take Gela to the Pool of Tears.
[B]3)[/B] [I]The Gela must be disposed of quickly.  I shall hurl it into the great Maelstrom, banishing it to the ocean floor.[/I]
		The player must take Gela to the Whirlpool.
[B]4)[/B] [I]Only the angels of Basium will know how to handle this.  I shall entrust the Gela to their care and bring it to their Gate.[/I]
		The player must take Gela to a  Mercurian city.  Basium cannot choose this.
[B]5)[/B] [I]The Gela must be destroyed!  I shall hurl it into the fires of Pyre of the Seraphic.[/I]
		The player must take Gela to the Pyre of the Seraphic.
[B]6)[/B] [I]The Gela contains much demonic power.  Perhaps I can harness it using the necromantic texts found in the Broken Sepulcher.[/I]
		The player must take Gela to the Broken Sepulcher.  Requires Evil.
[B]7)[/B] [I]Perhaps the Gela can be used for good, if properly energized.  I shall let it soak up the holy power of the Sun at the Mirror of Heaven.  But it will take time.[/I]
		The player must take Gela to the Mirror of Sun.  Requires Good.

	*Note: The player that triggers the quest does not need to own any of the buildings required or have the terrain under his or her control.

[B][U]Results[/U][/B]
[SPOILER][B]1)[/B]	The player keeps the Gela.  Nothing happens.

[B]2)[/B]	Player looses the Gela and gains a new item: Pike of Tears.  It grants the promotion “+1 affinity to Nature and Water mana” to the holder.  There is also a 50% of a minor plague occurring, 20% if state religion is FoL.  This would be similar to Armageddon's Blight, but 1/3 as strong.
[I]The Gela is plunged into the cold waters of the Pool of Tears.  The demonic taint washes off from the weapon in waves of oily blackness, mixing with the spring.  The Gela is no more, and in its place an even more powerful weapon has been created.  But at what cost?[/I]

If plague occurs: [I]The demon tainted water is carried far and wide throughout the land.  The world suffers, as do the people of Erebus.[/I]

[B]3)[/B]	The unit carrying Gela is destroyed.

a)	If the state religion of the player is OO, the player gains 4 Stygian Guard and a hero disciple of OO with the water walking promotion.
[I]The Maelstrom consumes the trident quickly and, miraculously, the waves grow calm.  A moment passes as the swirling vortex begins again.  Out of the center walks a man with bowed head, wearing the robes of a priest.  He is accompanied by four attendants.  The Overlords must be pleased…[/I]

b)	If the state religion of the player is not OO, 20 or so barbarian Stygian Guard and sea monsters spawn throughout the ocean.
[I]The ship is sacrificed and sucked into the turbulent vortex of the whirlpool.  A moment passes, and then the seas turn red.  A storm begins brewing on the horizon.  Something is not right.[/I]

[B]4)[/B]	The player looses the Gela.  +3 diplomacy bonus with Mercurians.  Armageddon counter gets -10.  The player is also granted a level 1 angel with the Hero promotion.
[I]Standing before the holy Gate of the Mercurians, the mighty Basium looks down upon you.  You offer up the Gela, and the Angel’s massive hand reaches down to take it.  “You have done well to rid Erebus of the demon Hyborem.  The angel’s shall sing your name in praise. But there is still much corruption in this land.  Take one of my finest newly reborn warriors to aid you in your battle.”[/I]

[B]5)[/B]	The player loses the Gela.  One of the following happens.

a)	The Pyre of the Seraphic is destroyed.  An item is created where it laid called "The Frozen Flame", which provides 1 Fire Mana, 1 Chaos Mana, and 1 Entropy mana, as well as -3 Unhappy.  40% chance.
[I]The Gela is hurled into the flames, which seem to flicker and burn eagerly for the demonic object.  The fires die down for a moment before flaring into an intensity that scorches the ceiling of the great temple.  Then, miraculously, the flames stop moving and grow black.  A piercing cry fills the Pyre, and looking into the flame one can now see the tortured souls used to forge the trident wailing in dispair.[/I]

b)	The equivalent of the Rite of Ogmha occurs.  The Pyre of the Seraphic is destroyed.  60% chance.
[I]The Gela is hurled into the flames, which seem to flicker and burn eagerly for the demonic object.  The weapon hisses for a brief moment and then, for the first time since it was lit, the fires burn out.   The very earth screams out in protest at the magical energies unleashed by the Gela’s destruction.  The ley lines leading to the Pyre, once invisible to the naked eye, are suddenly illuminated by the energy surging through them.  The phenomenon fades, and the temple now lies in ruins.[/I]

[B]6)[/B]	The player loses the Gela.  Armageddon counter gets +10.  -2 population in all your cities (except settlements).  40% chance to gain a Mane and Demonic Citizens per city.
[I]Using the necromantic texts found in the libraries left behind by Barbatos, you learn how to twist the demonic powers of the Gela to your will.  This ritual will unravel the unholy markings of the weapon, allowing you to guide the spirits of the recently departed away from Hell and into your own kingdom. It requires thousands of sacrifices.  You are fairly certain you have enough willing subjects.[/I]

[B]7)[/B]	The player loses the Gela, and the unit that was holding it is unable to move temporary from the Mirror of Heaven .  The Infernalsdeclare war on the player.  5 to 10 Hellfires appear near the Mirror, each with an Enraged Demonic Axeman.  After ten turns, the player receives Sol, a +1 Sun mana affinity weapon with +25% damage to undead, demon, and vampire.  -5 to Armageddon counter.
	When the Gela is brought to the Mirror of Heaven. [I]Your people place the Gela in the center of the Mirror of Heaven.  Inky black smoke begins to rise from the weapon in plumes as the sun purifies it.  This will take time, and surely attract the attention of any demons nearby.After some time, the weapon ceases to smoke, and the light of the Mirror shines brilliantly off of its surface.  The taint is removed, and in its place a holy trident of great power remains.[/I][/SPOILER]

################################ TO INCLUDE: Event Series by Xienwolf from http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=262009
I'd like to include some of this event series. The chances of the "story alternatives" should be based on environment (religions, alignment, civs... at best even player actions). The player has to think what f.e. the "passing stranger" could want; in an evil CoE city with high crime rate it will probably be a thief...

Note: For this next series of events, there are no tooltips to announce the rewards. Or alternatively, it is a single event with 3 possible outcomes from each decision (33% chance of each), and the player is allowed to see a tooltip stating what the possible outcomes are & the percent chances.
